### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I discovered programming during my first year in university, and haven't stopped since! My experience is primarily in numerical modelling of systems - namely F1 cars and Aerial Robotics (multicopters), and I am passionate about leveraging model to improve our understanding or utilisation of a system.

After completing the initial computing module during my degree (in MATLAB), I took the following summer to teach myself more general programming concepts in Javascript using FreeCodeCamp. Since then, I have learned Python and C++, and applied knowledge this professionally. I completed a High Performance Computing module in C++ as part my degree, achieving 97%. My CV can be found [here](https://github.com/kierandwn/curriculum-vitae).

What's currently on my plate:

- ðŸ”­ Currently working on: an equation of a motion propagator, [propagate](https://github.com/kierandwn/propagate), that I intend to use to build a quadcopter dynamic model, complete with multi-mode controller, navigation and Kalman estimation - and then build the quadcopter itself.  

- ðŸŒ± Currently learning: Machine Learning, following Stanford Andrew Ng's online course.

- ðŸ‘¯ Open to collaboration on my source agnostic time-series display & analysis tool, [insight](https://github.com/kierandwn/insight).
