An engineer specialising in numerics, I am passionate about combining lessons learned from theory with empirical knowledge - and formalising this in a model. I particularly enjoy using empirical data to inform a model: then interrogating it to increase our understanding of the system, in order to optimise its design or utilisation.

I have worked across disciplines: including system modelling (automotive/multicopter dynamics), control theory, autonomous navigation & estimation.

I take on the development of my own tools to aid my workflow where possible, and have familiarised myself with software design principles such as Object-Orientated Programming (OOP), Design Patterns, Test-Driven Development.

What's currently on my plate:

- ðŸ”­ Currently working on: quadcopter navigation & control solution. To be tested first in simulation, then flown on a custom built craft. Control to be based on spacecraft attitude control formulations for linear closed-loop dynamics, navigation to autonomous, with interaction with the user (myself) determined on the result of deep model output (CV).

- :sparkles: Finishing up: Low Mars Orbit (LMO) propagator for the simulation of science-craft in LMO communicating with mother-craft in Geostationary Mars Orbit (GMO). Included:
    - Attitude kinematics description library, [attitude](https://github.com/kierandwn/attitude); 
    - Full simulation, [capstone](https://github.com/kierandwn/capstone). 
    - Abstracted configuration of system dynamics solvers, control contributions and actuation models are to be pushed upstream to dynamics propagator project template, [propagate](https://github.com/kierandwn/propagate).

- ðŸŒ± Currently learning: Machine Learning (incl. Deep Learning & Reinforcement Learning), following Stanford Andrew Ng's online specialisation, and UCL/DeepMind co-authored RL YouTube series.

- ðŸ‘¯ Open to collaboration on: my source agnostic time-series display & analysis tool, [insight](https://github.com/kierandwn/insight).
